   Two years back, the Roy Rogers fast-food chain irked lunch
ladies everywhere with a commercial tweaking school-cafeteria
food and the dough-faced ladies who serve it, to the tune
"See You in September."
   The ads worked better than any Roy Rogers commercials
before -- but the chain, with tail between its legs, pulled
them after complaints by the American School Food Service
Association, the group that represents lunch ladies.

   Last week, though, Roy Rogers and its new owner, Hardee's
Food Systems, defiantly trotted out the commercial again.
"We're sorry if any group is offended by this . . . {but}
it's a fun commercial that's done in good taste. We told {Roy
Rogers} to go ahead and run it," declared John Merritt, a
Hardee's senior vice president, yesterday morning.
   Yet after just five days on the air, it looks like deja vu
at Roy Rogers. By yesterday afternoon, after much conferring
behind closed doors, the chain announced that it was pulling
the ad -- again.
   The reason? The lunch ladies revolted -- again. "We were
livid that the ads came back. We thought they had been sent
to the advertising graveyard," says a spokesman for the
School Food association.
   A humbled Mr. Merritt late yesterday explained that the
company reversed its decision because of "the bigger issue of
the role of food service in the American system." In other
words, enough abuse, already: "We {fast-food purveyors} are
already wrongfully blamed for a lot of the country's ills,
including global warming and the premature aging of the
adolescent population."
   Ironically, for all the fuss the commercial is raising,
Mr. Merritt says it wasn't resurrected as a publicity stunt,
but because it sold sandwiches and was a lot cheaper than
producing a new spot. The ad shows beefy cafeteria marms
shoving plateloads of stomach-churning, unidentifiable fare
toward the camera. "You know what September means," warns the
voiceover.
   By pulling the spot, Roy Rogers joins the ranks of other
American advertisers who have caved in to pressures from
interest groups. Not that those groups have had much of an
impact on sales; last year Clorox and Mennen emerged
unscathed from boycotts launched by the Rev. Donald Wildmon,
who charged that the companies bought air time on
"questionable" TV shows. Still, many advertisers now kowtow
to their attackers, apologize profusely and promise never to
repeat their sins.
   But the situation at Roy Rogers is an especially odd one,
considering the company has lived through it -- almost word
for word -- before.
   The first time around, in 1988, Roy Rogers's then-owner,
Marriott Corp., decided to pull the ads after the
food-service group threatened to boycott its hotels. After
the ads were pulled, the group insisted Marriott didn't move
quickly enough -- and boycotted anyway.
   This time, Roy's new attitude came from Hardee's, which
bought the fast-food chain from Marriott with plans to
convert the Roy Rogers outlets into Hardee's restaurants. As
the Roy Rogers chain shrinks, less attention is paid to its
marketing functions -- and less money is spent on its ads,
making the popular lunch-ladies ad seem like a sure-fire
winner.
   Considering Roy Rogers continues to exist only in a
handful of markets in the East, Hardee's didn't think anyone
would raise much of a fuss over a two-year-old commercial,
Mr. Merritt says.
   At the ad agency that created the spot, Washington-based
Earle Palmer Brown Cos., executives say they are confounded
by the whole turn of events. "Look, these people are totally
overreacting," says Mark Goldstein, the agency's president,
who says he still doesn't know what spot Roy's will run after
"Lunch Ladies" takes its final bow Friday.
   "I have very fond memories of the women who worked in the
cafeteria at my elementary school," he says. "The women in
this commercial remind me of them. When you're eight years
old, those women look bigger than you, they look older than
you . . . and they're strict]"

   Bank of Boston Ends
   Fairfield Financing,
   Slates Payment Plan

   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Fairfield Communities Inc. said First
National Bank of Boston terminated Fairfield's right to draw
additional loans under its $45 million revolving credit
facility, and is requiring Fairfield to repay the loan
outstanding amount of $23.2 million in 47 equal monthly
installments, beginning next month.
   The loss of financing will result in a "significantly"
reduced level of resort-site sales in the third-quarter, as
well as layoffs of an unspecified number of the company's
3,000 workers, said Fairfield, a developer of recreational
and retirement communities. As for earnings, the company said
it was "not yet able to quantify the scope, possible effects
or financial result" of the credit termination.

   Fairfield President John W. McConnell said the bank's
decision came as a surprise. "We've had a 20-year banking
relationship with the Bank of Boston, and we've never
defaulted," he said. Asked to explain the bank's move, Mr.
McConnell said, "That would be speculation. But we do know
that the Bank of Boston has written off hundreds of millions
in loans, and we know that Fairfield Communities' performance
has been less than satisfactory."
   In the second quarter, the Bank of Boston charged off $200
million in bad loans, enabling it to reduce its nonperforming
assets to $1.96 billion from $1.98 billion.
   In the year ended Dec. 31, Fairfield Communities posted a
loss of almost $25 million, or $2.27 a share, on revenue of
about $240 million. Almost $23 million of that loss came from
the sale of discontinued operations. In the first half of
1990, the company had net income of $1.7 million, or 16 cents
a share, including an $840,000 benefit from tax-loss
carry-forwards.
   Observers of the company said they shared Mr. McConnell's
puzzlement. Said Kenneth Campbell, president of Audit
Investments and editor of the Realty Stock Review, "It looks
like someone in Boston said, `Where can we get some money
back?' and went down the list of profitable customers."
   Others say Fairfield's mistake was simply being in the
real estate industry. "There's a generalized credit crunch
affecting real estate borrowers," said Sheldon Grodsky,
director of research for Kenneth, Jerome &amp; Co., adding that
the Bank of Boston in particular "has had its head handed to
itself in real estate lending."
   Mr. McConnell said Bank of Boston was "one of several"
major lenders to Fairfield. He said he had not been notified
of any other credit terminations. He said the $23.2 million
owed Bank of Boston represented less than 10% of Fairfield's
debt. He said the company would seek a lender to replace Bank
of Boston.

   Mail Boxes Etc., San Diego, said it recovered from an
insurance company $400,000 of a $2.8 million payment recently
made to settle certain litigation.
   The insurance recovery will result in a gain of about
$240,000 in the second quarter ending Oct. 31 because the
entire settlement amount has already been written off, the
company said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The litigation involved charges by Nancy Tash, daughter of
the company's late founder, Gerald Aul, that the company and
its president, Anthony DeSio, fraudulently induced her to
sell her 23% stake in 1983. Mail Boxes is a franchiser of
postal-business and communication service centers.

   Operation PUSH Keeps Up
   Pressure of Boycott on Nike

   Operation PUSH, the Chicago-based civil-rights group,
declined to end its national boycott of Nike Inc. products
despite the company's announcement Friday of new
affirmative-action goals.
   The Beaverton, Ore., athletic apparel company's new goals
include naming a minority to the Nike board, increasing the
number of non-white department heads by 10% within 12 months
and naming a minority vice president within 24 months.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Rev. Tyrone Crider, director of PUSH, called Nike's goals
"inadequate." He repeated PUSH's demand that Nike use
minority-owned banks, advertising agencies and other service
companies.
   "The boycott and blackout campaign against Nike has not
ended. In fact, our efforts have intensified," he said.
   Operation PUSH has called for the boycott because it says
that Nike gets about 30% of its $2.4 billion of annual
revenue from black customers, but invests little in the black
community and has no high-level black employees.
   Nike says it gets closer to 15% of its revenue from
blacks. It has defended its policies and has alleged that
PUSH has financial connections with rival athletic wear
company Reebok International Ltd. PUSH has denied the
allegation.
   In over-the-counter trading yesterday, Nike shares closed
at $73.25, down $2.25.

   Holnam Inc.'s holding company Holderman Inc. agreed to
increase its stake in the cement manufacturer to 89.3% from
87.2% by acquiring 22.2 million newly issued common shares
for $99.9 million.
   Separately, Dundee, Mich.-based Holnam said it expects a
loss of 10 cents to 15 cents a share in 1990 because of cost
increases and declining sales. The company earlier predicted
it would finish the year with net income of five to 10 cents
a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Holderman, a subsidiary of Holderbank Financiere Glaris
Ltd. in Zurich, Switzerland, agreed to purchase the shares at
$4.50 each. Proceeds from the sale will be used for the
retirement of existing debt and other general corporate
purposes, Holnam said.
